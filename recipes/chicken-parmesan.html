                Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style 
                restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to 
                make at home.

                Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. 
                The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a 
                little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your 
                chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual 
                Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. 
                Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.

                Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another 
                layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown 
                before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs.
