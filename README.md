this is starting of me learning about Js and CSS coding
I am doing so by using The Odin Project as my tutor.

I know basics about Js and CSS and I have quite well experience with HTML since my school days. CSS and Js were introduced to me in my later days of high school. Let's see how much my brain can take about these CSS and Js
