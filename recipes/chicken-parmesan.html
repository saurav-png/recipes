            <p>
                Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style 
                restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to 
                make at home.

                Unlike many restaurant preparations, this method doesn't overwhelm the chicken with sauce and cheese. 
                The key to great non-soggy chicken Parmesan? Don't put any sauce under the chicken cutlets, just a 
                little bit of sauce on top, so the breading stays relatively crisp. If you like a lot of sauce on your 
                chicken Parmesan, that's fine, you can always serve extra sauce on the side. I also use some actual 
                Parmesan cheese in this recipe! Curiously, most versions of chicken Parmesan only use mozzarella. 
                Here, I'm going with a delicious mixture of fresh mozzarella, tangy Provolone and real Parmesan.

                Another little trick I employ here is to add some grated Parmesan to the breadcrumbs, which adds another 
                layer of flavor. You'll fry the breadcrumb and Parmesan crusted chicken breasts just to golden brown 
                before transferring them to a baking pan and adding sauce (but not too much!), cheese, and herbs.

            <h4><strong>Ingredients Needed</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>    
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
                    <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
                    <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
                    <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
                    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                </ol>
